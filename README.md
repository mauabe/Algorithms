# Algorithms

This is a reppository for toy problems using algorithms. No special code here, just snippets of code ideas I use. 
Feel free to watch and learn, as I do often reading other people's solutions.



## Muhammad ibn Mūsa al-Khwarizmī ##

was an influential 9th century scholar, astronomer, geographer, and mathematician known especially for his contributions to the study of algebra. The latinization of his name, which meant ‘the native of Khwãrezm’ 
in Persian, gave English the word algorithm. He wrote a book in Arabic about Hindu-Arabic numerals; the Latin translation of 
the book title was **Algoritmi de numero Indorum** (in English *Al-Khwarizmi on the Hindu Art of Reckoning*).
